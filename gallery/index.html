                                        Once upon a time, there was a man who loved music. He was a street performer and he played his guitar every day in the park. One day, he found an old microphone in the trash and decided to use it for his performances. The microphone was magical and it made his voice sound like an angel’s. People started to gather around him and listen to his music. He became famous and started performing in big concerts. But he never forgot the magic of the old microphone that made him who he was.

                                        He found it on the street, a lone shoe, black and shiny. He picked it up and examined it. It was in good condition, barely worn. He wondered who had left it behind and why.

                                        He decided to keep it. Maybe he could find the other one someday. He put it in his backpack and walked on.

                                        He didn't notice the man following him, the man who had lost his shoe in a hurry. The man who had a secret to hide and a mission to complete.

                                        The shoe was the only clue.

                                        And he wanted it back.

He would bark when the villains appeared and wag his tail when the heroes won. One day, she found a book about a girl and her dog who went on an adventure. She read it to Max and imagined they were the ones having fun. When she finished, she hugged him and said, “You are my adventure, Max.” He licked her face and agreed.

She was constantly thinking about what she needed to do next and never took the time to enjoy the present moment. One day, she went on a hike with her friends and they came across a beautiful waterfall. As they stood there admiring the view, she realized that she had been missing out on so much by not being present in the moment. From that day on, she made a conscious effort to enjoy every moment and appreciate the beauty around her.”

                                                She was the eyecatcher of the town. Everyone admired her beauty, her grace, her charm. She had it all: a loving husband, a cozy house, a successful career. She was happy, or so it seemed.

                                                But behind the smile, there was a secret. A secret that haunted her every night. A secret that made her feel guilty, ashamed, and afraid. A secret that could ruin everything.

                                                She was the eyecatcher of the town. And she had an eye for someone else. Someone who was not her husband. Someone who was his brother.
